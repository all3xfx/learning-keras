simplest autoencoder example
 * autoencoder is kind of like PCA or kind of like zipping files, but is more noisy (kind of like human memory? chunking?)
 * deep autoencoder = layered autoencoder
   * from this link: NOTE TO SELF: TRY OUT TENSORBOARD CALLABLE FROM INTO KERAS
 * VAE = generative model = creates probably likely output, instead of acting like a strict input-output function
   * = input —(function)—> likey/probable output
